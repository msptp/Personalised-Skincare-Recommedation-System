# Personalised Skincare Recommendation System

## Executive Summary
The business challenge addressed was the lack of personalised skincare product recommendations, which often result in users buying products that do not adequately meet their needs. Many consumers face difficulties in finding suitable skincare products due to generic and one-size-fits-all recommendations. The hypothesis was that by leveraging user-specific data and clustering techniques, a recommendation engine could deliver more accurate and personalised skincare suggestions. This project, therefore, aimed to develop a personalised skincare recommendation app that caters to individual skin characteristics. At the heart of this app is a recommendation engine, designed with a structured logic workflow (see Figure 1) to provide tailored skincare suggestions.
